== Version 1.2 ==
Version 1.1 is the Java 1.5 (and later) compatible version of PrivilegedAccessor

FUNCTIONAL CHANGES:
* version 1.2 is no longer downward compatible to Java 1.3, but only to Java 1.5 (see version 1.1 for downward compatibility to Java 1.3).
* use varargs instead of object arrays to deliver parameters. Object arrays are only accepted when explicitly expected.

FEATURES:
* works with Java 5.0 variable parameter count (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, "Charlie", "Brown");) - thanks to Dan Richter for the advice
* works with Java 5.0 autoboxing (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, 1, false); instead of PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, new Integer(1), new Boolean(false));)
* changed unit-tests to use Java 5.0 features
* added some more unit-tests - coverage is now 100% for junit.extensions.PA and 92% for junit.extensions.PrivilegedAccessor
* improved error output
* removed methods that are no longer needed due to variable parameter count (e.g. invokeMethod() with 0 or 1 parameters)
* removed methods that are no longer needed due to autoboxing (e.g. setValue(primitive), invokeMethod(method, primitive))
* size of jar is dramatically reduced due to removal of no longer needed methods and test-classes (1/2 KB instead of 1 KB for V1.0)
* returns the exact type when instantiating objects (no need to cast)
* fixed minor javadoc typos

FIXED BUGS:
* works now with methods that require array type parameters (with the exception of object array parameters)
* removed test-classes from jar and src.zip

KNOWN BUGS:
* does not work with methods that require object array parameters
