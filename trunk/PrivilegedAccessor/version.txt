== Version 1.2 ==
Version 1.1 is the Java 1.5 (and later) compatible version of PrivilegedAccessor

* removed Java 1.3 downward compatibility - now works with Java 1.5 only (see Version 1.0.2 and onwards for Java 1.3 compatibility)
* works with Java 5.0 variable parameter count (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, "Charlie", "Brown");)
* works with Java 5.0 autoboxing (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, 1, false); instead of PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, new Integer(1), new Boolean(false));)
* changed unit-tests to use Java 5.0 features
* added some more unit-tests
* improved error output
* removed methods that are no longer needed due to variable parameter count (e.g. invokeMethod() with 0 or 1 parameters)
* removed methods that are no longer needed due to autoboxing (e.g. setValue(primitive), invokeMethod(method, primitive))
* removed test-classes from jar and src.zip

== Version 1.1 ==
Version 1.1 is the Java 1.3 (and later) compatible version of PrivilegedAccessor

* continuing Java 1.3 downward compatibility (i.e. all new features for V1.2 onwards can also be found under 1.1 onwards)
* added some more unit-tests (TODO)
* improved error output (TODO)
* removed test-classes from jar and src.zip (TODO)
