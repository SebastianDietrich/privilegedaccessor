== Version 1.2.1 (upcoming) ==
Version 1.2.1 is the upcoming Java 1.5 (and later) compatible version of PrivilegedAccessor. 

FUNCTIONAL CHANGES:
 * Issue 12: setValue() can now set values of (non-static) final fields now possible - usually fails with static final fields.

FEATURES:
 * imporved javadoc documentation

FIXED BUGS & ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Issue 12: setValue() can now set values of (non-static) final fields now possible - usually fails with static final fields.

KNOWN BUGS:
none

== Version 1.2 (25.2.2012) ==
Version 1.2 is the Java 1.5 (and later) compatible version of PrivilegedAccessor. 

FUNCTIONAL CHANGES:
 * version 1.2 is no longer downward compatible to Java 1.3, but only to Java 1.5 (see version 1.1 and onwards for downward compatibility to Java 1.3).
 * Issue 3: use varargs instead of object arrays to deliver parameters to PA. PrivilegedAccessor still works with object[].
 * Issue 2: provided methods to inspect an object - getFieldNames(), getMethodNames(), toString()

FEATURES:
 * works with Java 5.0 variable parameter count (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, "Charlie", "Brown");) - thanks to Dan Richter for the advice
 * works with Java 5.0 autoboxing (e.g. PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, 1, false); instead of PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, new Integer(1), new Boolean(false));)
 * changed unit-tests to use Java 5.0 features and run based on junit4
 * added some more unit-tests - coverage is now (maxed) at 96,3% for junit.extensions.PA and 92,2% for junit.extensions.PrivilegedAccessor
 * added some assertions to fail-fast
 * improved error output
 * removed methods that are no longer needed due to variable parameter count (e.g. invokeMethod() with 0 or 1 parameters)
 * removed methods that are no longer needed due to autoboxing (e.g. setValue(primitive), invokeMethod(method, primitive))
 * returns the exact type when instantiating objects (no need to cast)
 * fixed minor javadoc typos
 * works as well with private member classes
 * added methods to get all attribute names and all method signatures

FIXED BUGS & ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Issue 3: works now with methods that require array type parameters
 * removed test-classes from jar and src.zip
 * Issue 7: works now with methods that require object array parameters

KNOWN BUGS:
none
