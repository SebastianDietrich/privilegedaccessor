*PrivilegedAccessor* is a simple to use Java framework for accessing `private` methods, attributes, and constructors via reflection.
<g:plusone size="medium"></g:plusone>
= Introduction =
In unit-testing you often need to prepare and later inspect the unit-under-test before you can test it. For instance you might need to inject mock-objects in your unit, so your unit-test does not access other units like backend systems. Or you might need to access a private attribute to assert a post-condition of a unit after the test.

This could be easily done if Java had no modifiers like `private`. Accessing private (or `protected` or package private) methods, attributes, and constructors from outside is forbidden. And you should _never change the modifiers of your production code just for unit-testing purposes_!!!

Fortunately we have reflection to access everything in our classes. Unfortunately reflection is somehow complicated:

*Example:*
Accessing the private (`float`) field `salary` of the object `boss` of class `Manager` via reflection:
<code language="java">
try {
  Field field = Manager.class.getDeclaredField(salary);
  field.setAccessible(true);
  float howMuchMyBossEarns = (float) field.get(boss);
} catch (NoSuchFieldException e) {
  assert false: "class 'Manager' has no field 'salary'";
} catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
  assert false : "could not access field 'salary'";
  return null;
}
</code>

With PrivilegedAccessor the same task is much less work:
<code language="java">
float howMuchMyBossEarns = PA.getValue(boss, "salary");
</code>

== Download ==
You can download PrivilegedAccessor via [https://code.google.com/p/privilegedaccessor/downloads/list Downloads] or from maven central using:
{{{
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.e-movimento.tinytools</groupId>
  <artifactId>privilegedaccessor</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
}}}

== How does it work ==
PrivilegedAccessor is based on Java reflection and the possibility to change access-rights via "setAccessible(true)".
PrivilegedAccessor tries to find the method, attribute, constructor you want to access, sets its accessibility to true and accesses it.

== How can you use it ==
The usage of PrivilegedAccessor is rather simple. Use the following to access your otherwise unaccessible code:

 * PA.getValue(Object objectOrClass, String attribute-name) - to read a private attribute
 * PA.setValue(Object objectOrClass, String attribute-name, Object new-value) - to change a private attribute
 * PA.instantiate(Class clazz) - to instantiate a class via its private constructor
 * PA.instantiate(Class clazz, Object... parameters) - to instantiate a class via a private constructor with parameters
 * PA.invokeMethod(Object objectOrClass, String methodSignature, Object... args) - to invoke a private method
 * PA.getFieldNames(Object objectOrClass) - to get all fields of an object or class (including fields of super-classes)
 * PA.getMethodSignatures(Object objectOrClass) - to get all method signatures of an object or class (including super-classes)

PA (the convenience short form for PrivilegedAccessor) works with varargs and autoboxing and only throws RuntimeExceptions.

== Examples ==
 * `PA.getValue(myObject, "myAttribute");`
 * `PA.setValue(myObject, "myAttribute", 42);`
 * `PA.setValue(myObject, "myAttribute", 42).setValue("myOtherAttribute", "newValue");`
 * `PA.instantiate(MyClass.class);`
 * `PA.instantiate(MyClass.class, "Hello", "World", 42);`
 * `PA.invokeMethod(myObject, "sayHello(java.lang.Integer)", 42);`

== Caveats ==
 * be sure to always use the full method signature for invokeMethod - i.e. including fully qualified parameter classes (e.g. `PA.invokeMethod(myObject, "setName(java.lang.String)", "Tom");)`
 * you can use all sorts of arguments (primitives, objects and arrays)
 * you can access private inner classes - but you need to add the surrounding object as first argument - e.g. `PA.instantiate(Class.forName("MyClass$MyInnerClass"), myObject);` (this is not necessary for private static nested classes)
 * you can access final fields, but not change final static fields

== Compatibility ==
 * PrivilegedAccessor V 1.1 is downward compatible to Java 1.3 (tested), but should work as well with newer releases (tested up to Java 1.7)
 * PrivilegedAccessor V 1.2 and onwards is downward compatible to Java 1.5 (tested), but should work as well with newer releases (tested up to Java 1.7)

PrivilegedAccessor uses a lot of unit tests to check its functionality - if you find a bug or missing feature, please feel free to contact us.

== Advise ==
*Do not use PrivilegedAccessor in production code* - since it undermines the information hiding principle.
Use it ONLY for testing or test setup/teardown purposes - e.g. for assigning mock objects, or asserting post-conditions.
